    <br />    <br />
    It's great to meet you! This GitHub is a collection of my writings, tools, and miscellaneous contributions. 
    <br />    
    I'm just rebuilding this GitHub after years of closed source contributions, 
    <br />  
    so check back often as content is open sourced!

<!-- ABOUT ME -->
## About Kristopher

I am a developer relations and technical marketing veteran with over a decade of experience. I've been writing since 2013 - you can find the bulk of my content at [Nordic APIs](https://nordicapis.com/author/sandovaleffect/). I am currently in the process of backing up the markdown versions of my articles to create a library of my content.
