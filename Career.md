# My Career
In 2013, I had just graduated with an AAS in Network Administration. In classic netadmin behaviour, I decided I actually hated netadmin. Looking at my options for a career, I could either go into entertainment marketing or into tech. I made the wild choice to do both.

Here's a summary of my career so far:
